Base block which must be defended - destruction = game over

Resource blocks which can be mined/collected/scavenged from enemies to build defenses

Defenses - static walls, manual weapons/emplacements, automated turrets, free-roaming defensive AI

Enemies - spawn in at (destructible?) spawner block at set intervals, move initially in straight line from spawner to base block
